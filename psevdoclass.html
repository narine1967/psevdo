   <p>Erythrina berteroana is native to southern Mexico, Central America, 
     Guatemala and Venezuela. It grows at altitudes of up to 1,800 m (6,000 ft)
      in areas where the annual precipitation is between 1,500 and 4,000 mm
       (60 and 160 in). It prefers acidic soils (to pH 4) and tolerates high levels
        of aluminium in the soil. It flourishes in a range of temperatures and 
        is probably frost resistant.[1]</p>
